      Within the National Federation of Gold Factories (FENOR), the Department
      of Goldsmithing and Jewelry serves as the link between extraction,
      innovation, skilled craftsmanship, and market-ready finishing. We work to
      support a structured value chain that promotes local processing,
      reinforces quality standards, and encourages sustainable practices. This
      approach helps transform Mauritania’s gold into competitive products that
      create jobs, strengthen industrial capacity, and generate long-term
      national value.
