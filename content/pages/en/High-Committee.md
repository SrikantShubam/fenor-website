      The High Committee of the National Federation of Gold Factories (FENOR)
      represents the organization’s highest strategic authority, bringing
      together distinguished leaders with deep experience in governance,
      industry, and national development.


      Entrusted with guiding FENOR’s long-term vision, the High Committee plays
      a vital role in setting strategic directions, strengthening institutional
      frameworks, and ensuring alignment with national priorities for the gold
      mining sector.


      Through insight, oversight, and collective wisdom, the High Committee
      supports FENOR’s mission to promote responsible, sustainable, and
      inclusive growth within Mauritania’s artisanal and semi-industrial gold
      mining industry.
