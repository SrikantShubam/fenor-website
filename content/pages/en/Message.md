      Dear Esteemed Members, Partners, and Interested Parties,


      I extend to you my warmest greetings and highest respect.


      In service of the artisanal and semi-industrial gold mining community, we
      at the National Federation of Gold Factories play a vital role,
      maintaining an active presence focused on organizing, supporting, and
      empowering stakeholders in this sector.


      We continuously strive to provide support and assistance to our members,
      including investors and actors, and work to deliver the services and
      information they need to grow their businesses and enhance their
      leadership.


      In addition, we are diligently working to achieve a balance between the
      requirements of economic development and environmental sustainability.


      We pledge to continue our efforts to foster economic prosperity and to
      achieve sustainable development in Mauritania, in line with the State’s
      directions and its support for economic, social, and political development
      goals under the leadership of His Excellency the President of the
      Republic.
