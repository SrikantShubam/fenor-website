      The National Federation of Gold Factories is an organization that brings
      together investors and stakeholders in the artisanal and semi-industrial
      gold mining sector. It is a member of the National Union of Mauritanian
      Employers and is headquartered in the capital, Nouakchott.


      The Federation is committed to protecting the material and moral interests
      of its members, representing them before various bodies, and supporting
      their investments through the provision of technical and administrative
      advice.


      Among its priorities, the Federation also aims to attract foreign
      investment, improve the working environment in the artisanal and
      semi-industrial mining sector, and organize the sector to enhance its
      development and increase its contribution to the national economy.
